Exoskeletons are robots attached to the extremities of the human
body focused on increasing their strength, speed and performance
primarily. The main applications are in the military, industry and
medicine. The exoskeleton can be used for the rehabilitation of
limbs because of accident or illness that can cause little muscle
activity or null. In this thesis we present a exoskeleton of two
degrees of freedom that used to do active and passive exercises
rehabilitation under the ankle and knee, mainly the design and
manufacture of the exoskeleton is based on the instrumentation of a
right lower limb orthoses. The exoskeleton contains sensors to
estimate the force produced by a human and are incorporated in the
SEA actuators (Serial Elastics Actuators) used to amplify the human
force. Moreover contains sensors to estimate the angular position
and velocity in joints used to control the movement of the leg. In
this thesis we present: A study of the dynamic model of the
exoskeleton and actuators, the design of a control based on the sum of forces
generated by the human and the exoskeleton, the design and
fabrication of  a experimental prototype. were performed a
Simulations to show a comparison between three types of control laws
(PD with gravity compensation, PD with adaptive compensation and
sliding mode control). Experimental results show that there is an
amplification of the force generated by the user and amplified by
the mechanical exoskeleton, offering a reduction in the effort of
the user to perform rehabilitation exercise with movements of
flexion and extension on the joint (Knee and Ankle)
