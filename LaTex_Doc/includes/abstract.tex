\vspace{3cm}

This thesis is about the modelling, development and control of a two axis camera Pan-Tilt unit (gimbal) which was meant to be attached to a UAV aircraft for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. The goal of this thesis is to develop a control structure for stabilize the camera optical axis towards a target by isolating the camera from the disturbances induced by the operating environment, such as external torques and platform angular motion.\\ 

The equations of motion are derived by the Newton Euler Method and and they are formulated in a suitable form so the properties of the system can be interpreted and analyzed. With aid of CAD software inertial data is obtained and for the control algorithms several simulations are developed. We proceed to the construction of the prototype and programming the microcontroller used. Finally several experimental tests are performed to obtain and verify results.
